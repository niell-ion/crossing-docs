## Towing Procedure

!!! caution "Towing Advisory"

### Securing Components

!!! warning "Secure Before Towing"
    Failure to secure all components before moving or towing the trailer may result in injury and/or damage to equipment.



**Step 1: Dissasemble and Secure the Arm**  

* Remove arm sections one at a time. Stow sections in holder and secure with included clamp.

**Step 2: Secure the Lights**

**Step 3: Lower the Crossbuck and Antennas**

* Use the crank to lower the crossbuck and antennas

**Step 4: Stow Arm Counterweights**

* Ensuring Step 1 has been completed, Remove the counterweight nuts. **Do not remove the counterweight backstop.**

* Remove the counterweights one at a time. Stow on the trailer deck using the provided mounting studs, finishing with the counterweight nuts to keep them in place during transit.



## Site Preparation

### Check Clearance

Before finalizing trailer placement or beginning system operation, verify that all mounted components — particularly the arm assembly and sign structure — have adequate clearance in their intended orientation and operating range.



**Step 1: Verify Arm Orientation**

* Confirm that the arm assembly is installed facing the correct direction relative to the trailer frame (refer to Figure 4-3).

* The pivot or hinge side should align with the mounting reference point specified in the assembly drawing.

* Ensure there are no obstructions above or beside the arm that could interfere with its full range of motion.



**Step 2: Check Sign Orientation**

* The sign face should be perpendicular to the direction of approaching traffic or as required by the installation plan.

* Verify that the top and bottom edges are parallel to the trailer deck once the trailer is fully leveled.

* If applicable, confirm that the sign conforms to MUTCD visibility and height requirements. The lower edge of the sign should typically be at least 7 ft (2.1 m) above the ground surface in pedestrian areas, or as required by local code.



**Step 3: Measure Operational Clearance**

* With the arm extended to its full working position, measure the horizontal and vertical clearances around the structure.

* Maintain a minimum of 12 in (305 mm) of clearance from any moving or rotating component to nearby surfaces, fixtures, or cables.

* If operating near buildings or trees, confirm that the arm and sign have unrestricted motion through their full intended range.



**Step 4: Lock and Secure**

* After verifying clearances, tighten all pivot bolts, clamps, or lock pins to manufacturer specifications.

* Confirm that no cables or hoses are under tension or pinched during movement of the arm or sign.



### Check Levelness

**Step 1: Inspect the Ground Surface**

* Choose a compact, load-bearing surface such as concrete, asphalt, or well-compacted gravel.

* Avoid locations with loose soil, soft clay, grass, or sand, as these may settle unevenly under the trailer’s weight.

* Ensure there are no depressions, mounds, or large stones beneath the jack points. These can cause twisting of the frame or difficulty in leveling.



**Step 2: Assess Surface Drainage**

* Select an area with good runoff so water will not pool under or around the trailer.

* Avoid low-lying areas that retain moisture, which can cause the trailer to settle into the ground.



**Step 3: Check for Slope and Elevation**

!!! Caution "Levelness"
    Operating the trailer on an uneven or unstable surface can result in frame misalignment, inaccurate leveling, or equipment damage.

* Use a 2–4 ft bubble level, laser level, or straightedge and ruler to check the surface in both directions.

* The surface should not vary by more than **½ inch** over the length of the trailer (12 ft) or **¼ inch** across the width (8 ft).

* If the variation exceeds these limits, adjust by relocating the trailer or using leveling pads under the jacks.



**Step 4: Prepare the Contact Area**

* Clear debris, gravel clusters, or vegetation from under each jack location.

* If the surface is uneven, place solid wooden or composite blocks beneath the jacks to distribute load evenly.

* Never use rocks, bricks, or cinder blocks, as they may fracture under pressure.



### Determine Solar Angle

For optimal charging performance, the solar panel must receive unobstructed, direct sunlight between **10:00 AM and 3:00 PM**.
Ensure there is no shading from nearby structures, railcars, vegetation, or other equipment during these hours.

If the site receives limited sunlight or experiences partial shading, a second solar panel may be installed to maintain adequate system charging capacity.



**Step 1: Determine Panel Direction**

* For installations north of the Equator, the solar panel should face **south** for optimal efficiency.

* Observe the site and ensure that the solar panel will receive sun once installed.

* Two locations with **1/4"-20** threaded stud patterns are provided for mounting the solar panel and light assemblies.

* The solar panel must be mounted on the stud pattern closest to the side of the device that will receive the most sunlight.  



**Step 1: Measure Tilt Angle**

The optimal tilt angle for solar panel efficiency depends on the latitude of the installation site.

* Use a maps or GPS app to measure the site latitude.

* Set the tilt angle equal to the latitude.

!!! example
    Latitude = 38.2° → Tilt angle = **38.2°**



**Step 2: Seasonal adjustments:**

* Winter = **Latitude + 15°**  

* Summer = **Latitude – 15°**  

* Spring/Fall = **Latitude only**  

!!! example
    Spring/Fall tilt angle = **38.2°**  
    Winter tilt angle = 38.2° + 15° = **53.2°**  
    Summer tilt angle = 38.2° – 15° = **23.2°**  



### Leveling the Trailer

The trailer is equipped with four corner-mounted leveling jacks, one at each corner of the frame. These jacks are used to stabilize and level the trailer after it has been positioned at the installation site.

!!! warning "Level with Corner Jacks Only"
    Do not use the fifth-wheel jack (tongue jack) to support or level the trailer.
    The fifth-wheel jack is intended only for hitching and towing. Using it for leveling may cause frame distortion or unsafe loading.



**Step 1: Preparing to Level**

* Inspect the ground. Verify that the surface beneath each jack is firm, flat, and load-bearing. If the site is gravel or soil, place a concrete paver, composite pad, or steel plate beneath each jack foot to prevent sinking or shifting.

* Check jack condition. Ensure each jack is free of rust, bends, or mechanical damage. Confirm that all mounting bolts are tight and that the jack threads or screw mechanisms move smoothly.

* Confirm travel range. Each jack must have sufficient travel to raise the trailer until the wheels are just off the ground. This ensures all load weight is transferred to the jacks for accurate leveling.



**Step 2: Leveling Procedure**

* Park the trailer in the desired position and set the wheel chocks to prevent rolling.

* Disconnect the trailer from the towing vehicle if necessary.

* Lower the corner jacks, starting with the rear jacks to stabilize the frame.

* Lower each jack until it makes firm contact with the ground or paver.

* Then lower the front jacks, adjusting each incrementally.



**Step 3: Adjust to Level**

* Place a bubble or digital level on the trailer frame or deck.

* Adjust opposing jacks (A–C and B–D, see Figure 4-1) in small increments until the trailer is level front-to-back and side-to-side.

* Continue fine adjustments until the trailer frame is fully level and stable, and all four jacks share the load evenly.



**Step 4: Verify Clearance and Levelness**

* Ensure the wheels are off the ground and the jack arms are extended within safe limits.

* Check that arm, lights, and crossbuck meet MUTCD height requirements relative to roadway.

* The trailer must remain stationary and rigid when moderate force is applied to any corner.
