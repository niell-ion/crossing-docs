## Towing Procedure

!!! warning "Towing"
    Trailer is not registered for towing on public roads. Trailer must be transported via flatbed to traverse public roads.  
    
- Securing components for towing
   - Arm  
   - Lights  
   - Sign  

## Site Preparation

- Clearance


- Orientation of arm and sign


- Levelness/flatness


- Solar angle  

### Trailer Jacks

The trailer has leveling jacks located at each of the four corners.

!!! warning "Jack Warning"
    Do not use the fifth wheel jack to support or level the trailer
    
- Must have enough travel to lift tires off the ground
- Firm enough ground
- Concrete paver/footer
- Check arm height, must be MUTCD regulation compliant
- Trailer is level, wheels are off the ground
- Relative distance calculation
- Only use corner jacks

- Leveling the trailer jacks

## Setup

!!! warning "Levelness"
    Trailer leveling must be complete before proceeding with setup
    
!!! warning "Weather"
    Before beginning trailer setup, check weather forecast. Do not attempt setup in high winds or lighting.

Refer to WCH Manual
- Arm setup

### Solar Panel Setup

For proper operation, the solar panel must receive direct sunlight from **10:00 AM** to **3:00 PM** without obstruction from structures, railcars, or vegetation.  

For installations north of the Equator, the solar panel should face **south** for optimal efficiency.

* Observe the site and ensure that the solar panel will receive sun once installed.

* Two locations with **1/4"-20** threaded stud patterns are provided for mounting the solar panel and light assemblies.

* The solar panel must be mounted on the stud pattern closest to the side of the device that will receive the most sunlight.  

**Step 1: Measure Tilt Angle**

The optimal tilt angle for solar panel efficiency depends on the latitude of the installation site.

* Use a maps or GPS app to measure the site latitude.

* Set the tilt angle equal to the latitude.

!!! example
    Latitude 38.2° → Tilt angle **38.2°**

**Step 2: Seasonal adjustments:**

* Winter: **Latitude + 15°**  

* Summer: **Latitude – 15°**  

* Spring/Fall: **Latitude only**  

!!! example
    Spring/Fall tilt angle = **38.2°**  
    Winter tilt angle = 38.2 + 15 = **53.2°**  
    Summer tilt angle = 38.2 – 15 = **23.2°**
