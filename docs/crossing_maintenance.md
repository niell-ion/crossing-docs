## Maitenance Schedule

### Every 6 Months

* Clean solar panels.

### Every 12 Months

* Lubricate leveling jacks.
* Recharge AGM batteries.



## Jack Maintenance


## Battery Maintenance

* Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) batteries require periodic recharging to maintain capacity and ensure reliable system performance. Even when the trailer is not in active use, the batteries should be recharged on a regular schedule to prevent sulfation and capacity loss.

* Recharge Schedule

# Active Systems (with solar input):

* When solar panels are connected and operational, the charge controller will maintain the 24 V battery bank automatically.

* Verify that system voltage remains above 25.2 V during regular use.

* If voltage drops below 24.4 V, perform a full recharge using an approved external charger.

### Inactive or Stored Systems:
* If the trailer is stored indoors or disconnected from solar power:

* Recharge every 60–90 days using a compatible 24 V AGM charger or a dual 12 V charger configured for series connection.

* Maintain resting voltage between 25.6–26.4 V for long-term storage.



### Charging Procedure

**Step 1: Inspect the Battery Bank**

Check all terminals, interconnect cables, and fuses for corrosion or looseness.

Clean terminals using a non-metallic brush and verify tight mechanical connections.

**Step 2: Select an Appropriate Charger**

Use a smart charger rated for 24 V AGM batteries with automatic bulk, absorption, and float modes.

Charging profile should reach 28.8–29.4 V during the absorption phase and hold 26.4–27.0 V during float mode.

Avoid unregulated or “boost” chargers, which can cause overcharging and thermal damage.

**Step 3: Connect the Charger**

Attach the positive (red) lead to the battery bank’s positive (+) terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative (–) terminal.

Confirm correct polarity and tight contact before turning on the charger.

**Step 4: Monitor Charging Progress**

Allow charging to continue until the battery reaches 100 % state of charge, as indicated by charger status or stabilized current.

When charging completes, verify voltage has settled to approximately 26.0–26.4 V after one hour at rest.

**Step 5: Disconnect and Record**

Turn off the charger, disconnect leads in reverse order, and note the recharge date, final voltage, and any observations in the maintenance log.



## Before Towing

* Check leveling and tounge jack lubrication.

* Check tire air pressure.
